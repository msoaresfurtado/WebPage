      I am a NASA Hubble Fellow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My work intersects theory and observation, as I leverage data to build models that reproduce the observational properties of stars. 
      I am particularly interested in investigating cluster stars that exhibit anomalous rotational signatures and peculiar abundances. <em>What percentage of such stars were produced by planetary ingestion events?</em>

      I obtained my Bachelor's degree in physics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
      In 2020, I received my Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences from Princeton University. 
      I am a first-generation college student and the daughter of an immigrant family (migration to the US from the Povoação and Nordeste regions of São Miguel, Azores in 1966). 
      <a href="URL_to_history_of_Azores">Here, you can learn more about the history of the Azores</a> (long considered a colony of Portugal and now an autonomous, self-governing region of Portugal).

      My hobbies include photography and amassing a collection of rare astronomy textbooks. 
      Our family recently adopted Murphy and Lily Belle, two energetic golden retrievers that love hiking and snacks.
