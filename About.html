        I am an astrophysicist studying stellar clusters, stars, exoplanets, and exomoons. 
        To investigate open questions in these astrophysical subdomains, I draw insights from observational data (photometric and spectroscopic) and computational simulations. 
        I am currently working as a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-awards-postdoctoral-fellowships-for-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> and as a Science Affiliate at the <a href="https://space.mit.edu/">MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research</a>.</p>
    <p>I will begin a tenure-track faculty appointment in the Department of Physics and the Department of Astronomy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Fall 2024. <em><a href="https://badgerband.wisc.edu/music/on-wisconsin-2/" class="highlighted">On, Wisconsin!</a></em></p>

      I obtained my Bachelor's degree in physics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
      In 2020, I received my Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences from Princeton University. 
      I am a first-generation college student and the daughter of an immigrant family (migration to the US from the <a href="https://vimeo.com/317880007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Povoação and Nordeste regions</a> of <a href="https://vimeo.com/304666918" target="_blank"rel="noopener noreferrer">São Miguel, Azores</a> in 1966). 
      Here, you can learn more about the history of the Azores</a> (long considered a colony of Portugal and now an autonomous, self-governing region of Portugal). 
      A study of the genetic make-up of the people who inhabit this remote archipelago can be found <a href="https://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/21207/InTech-The_genetic_makeup_of_azoreans_versus_mainland_portugal_population.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

      My hobbies include photography and amassing a collection of rare astronomy textbooks. 
      Our family recently adopted Murphy and Lily Belle, two energetic golden retrievers that love hiking and snacks.
